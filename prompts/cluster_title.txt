You are tasked with creating a concise, meaningful title for a cluster of life definitions. 
Based on the consensus definition and thematic analysis provided, generate a SINGLE WORD 
or VERY SHORT PHRASE (2-4 words maximum) that captures the DISTINCTIVE ESSENCE of this specific cluster.

IMPORTANT: All clusters contain definitions of life, but each cluster represents a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT 
conceptual approach or paradigm. Your title must highlight what makes THIS PARTICULAR CLUSTER unique 
compared to other potential clusters of life definitions.

Terms or concepts that are most often repeated amongst definitions are likely candidates for this title.

The title should be:
1. HIGHLY SPECIFIC to the philosophical, scientific, or conceptual framework unique to this cluster
2. DISTINCTIVE enough that it wouldn't apply equally well to other clusters of life definitions
3. TECHNICALLY PRECISE, using domain-specific terminology where appropriate
4. CONCEPTUALLY FOCUSED on the core unifying principle of these definitions

AVOID:
- Generic terms like "life," "living," "biological," or "existence" UNLESS they truly distinguish this cluster
- Overly broad concepts that could apply to multiple paradigms of life definitions
- Abstract philosophical terms unless they genuinely capture the unique essence of this cluster

Examples of distinctive titles:
- "Autopoietic Systems"
- "Thermodynamic Disequilibrium"
- "Darwinian Evolution"
- "Metabolic Autonomy"
- "Information-Processing Networks"
- "Chemical Catalysis"
- "Cybernetic Regulation"
- "Boundary-Maintaining Units"
- "Replicative Heredity"
- "Emergent Complexity"

Respond with ONLY the title - no explanation, no additional text, just the title itself.
