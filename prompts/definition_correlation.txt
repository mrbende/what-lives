Compare two definitions of "what is life" and output a single correlation coefficient between -1.0 and 1.0, where:

-1.0 = Fundamentally opposing or incompatible primary frameworks:
- Definitions make directly contradictory central claims about life's nature
- Core mechanisms/principles are mutually exclusive 
- Ontological commitments cannot be reconciled (e.g., materialist vs vitalist)
- One definition explicitly rejects the foundational premise of the other

-0.7 to -0.9 = Strong conceptual opposition:
- Primary explanatory mechanisms are in direct tension
- Core phenomena emphasized are framed as alternatives to each other
- Theoretical traditions actively compete to explain the same aspects
- Definitions reflect opposing sides of established dichotomies in the field

-0.4 to -0.6 = Moderate conceptual tension:
- Different primary elements with partially contradictory implications
- Compatible in some domains but contradictory in others
- Competing emphasis on different scales/phenomena as primary
- Explanatory frameworks that partially undermine each other

-0.1 to -0.3 = Mild conceptual tension:
- Largely independent with some points of philosophical tension
- Different domains with minor areas of overlapping contradiction
- Emphasis on phenomena that suggest different boundaries for life
- Compatible primary frameworks with some conflicting secondary claims

0.0 = Orthogonal conceptual frameworks:
- Focus on entirely different dimensions of life
- No meaningful overlap in core explanatory elements
- Different levels of analysis without significant contradiction
- Separate explanatory traditions addressing different questions

0.1 to 0.3 = Minimal conceptual overlap:
- Largely independent frameworks with slight points of agreement
- Different primary phenomena with minor shared secondary elements
- Compatible but mostly distinct explanatory approaches
- Shared terminology but applied to different aspects or scales

0.4 to 0.6 = Moderate conceptual alignment:
- Partial overlap in primary explanatory mechanisms
- Complementary emphasis on different aspects of the same phenomena
- Compatible frameworks that could be integrated with significant work
- Similar causal elements but different organizational principles

0.7 to 0.9 = Strong conceptual alignment:
- Substantial overlap in primary explanatory frameworks
- Same core phenomena with variations in emphasis or extension
- Shared fundamental principles with different elaborations or applications
- Compatible ontological commitments with different specific mechanisms

1.0 = Complete conceptual alignment:
- Identical primary explanatory elements and emphasis
- Same core phenomena, mechanisms, and necessary conditions
- Matching ontological commitments and boundary definitions
- Equivalent central claims with at most minor terminological differences

When analyzing, evaluate alignment across these key dimensions:
1. Ontological claims: What fundamental entities/properties constitute life?
2. Boundary conditions: How is living distinguished from non-living?
3. Causal architecture: What mechanisms/principles explain life's operation?
4. Phenomenological focus: Which observable aspects of life are emphasized?
5. Temporal scope: How are origins, maintenance, and evolution addressed?
6. Explanatory level: What scale/domain is centered (molecular, cellular, systemic)?
7. Epistemological approach: How is life to be understood or investigated?

Dimensional variation analysis:
- Definitions may align on some dimensions while diverging on others
- Weight core claims and central mechanisms more heavily than peripheral aspects
- Consider both explicit statements and implicit assumptions
- Evaluate if differences are truly contradictory or potentially complementary
- Assess if one definition subsumes or extends the other
- Consider if definitions address the same questions or different questions

Scoring calibration:
- Definitions must align on most dimensions for scores above 0.7
- Different primary mechanisms should generally score below 0.5
- Contradictory claims about essential properties must score below 0.0
- Definitions from opposing philosophical traditions typically score -0.3 to -0.7
- Scores near zero indicate definitions that are conceptually "ships passing in the night"
- When dimensions show mixed alignment/opposition, weight more central dimensions higher

Example benchmarks:
- A purely thermodynamic vs purely informational definition ≈ 0.0 to 0.2
- A metabolism-first vs replication-first definition ≈ -0.4 to -0.6
- Two thermodynamic definitions with different boundary conditions ≈ 0.7 to 0.8
- A definition based on reproduction vs one rejecting reproduction as necessary ≈ -0.7
- A definition about biochemical structures vs one about functional dynamics ≈ 0.1 to 0.3
